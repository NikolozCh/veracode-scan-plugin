		Enter the replacement pattern that represents the groups captured by the filename pattern.
		For example, if the filename pattern is '*-*-SNAPSHOT.war' and the replacement pattern '$1-SNAPSHOT.war',
		an uploaded file named 'app-branch-SNAPSHOT.war' would be saved as 'app-SNAPSHOT.war'.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to specify a replacement pattern that includes a reference to a captured group followed by a number
		place the captured group's index inside curly braces. For example, if the filename pattern is '*-*-SNAPSHOT.war'
		and the replacement pattern is '${1}5-SNAPSHOT.war', an uploaded file named 'app-branch-SNAPSHOT.war' would be
		saved as 'app5-SNAPSHOT.war'.
	</p>
	<p>
		New filenames for uploaded files must be valid. Path separators ('\' or '/') should not be included.
	</p>
	<p>
		No uploaded files are saved with a different name when either the filename pattern or the replacement pattern is omitted.
